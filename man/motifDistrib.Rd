\title{profile TFBS distribution}
\usage{
motifDistrib(id, peak_list, peak_id, plot_at_each_side = 100,
  TFregulome_url)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Required. TFregulome ID. The TFBS of interest to be profiled.}

\item{peak_list}{Required. List of data.frames, each of which contains bed-format peak regions. They are the peak sets in which you want to profile the TFBS distributions, and can be loaded from TFregulome database or self-provided.}

\item{peak_id}{Required. Character of vector, each of which is a unique ID corresponding to the element in "peak_list". If a peak set is orignally from TFregulome Database, its TFregulome ID should be used here.}

\item{plot_at_each_side}{By default 100bp, and motif occurrences in a window of +/- 100bp around peak centres will be returned.}

\item{TFregulome_url}{TFregulome server is implemented in MethMotif server. If the MethMoitf url is NO more "http://bioinfo-csi.nus.edu.sg/methmotif/", please use a new url.}
}
\value{
a list containing the numbers of input peaks and peaks with motif, as well as motif occurrences in the plot window.
}
\description{
This function allows you to profile TFBS distributions in a given list of peak sets.

\examples{
CEBPB_peaks <- loadPeaks(id = "MM1_HSA_K562_CEBPB")
